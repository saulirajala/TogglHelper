# Toggl Helper
Toggl Helper -plugin for Wordpress. Requires Advanced Custom Fields


##TODO:
1. Dynamic statistic to fronpage (so that it echoes current week hours)
2. Shortcode for printing the week/month/year -statistics. Few problems though:
    1. Fronpage week statistic works only if there are 5 workday in a week, so for example finnish arkipyh√§t are bad
    2. Month workhours statistic to fronpage (same problem as in 1.)
    3. Year workhours statistic to fronpage (same problem as in 1.)
3. Put api key and other options to admin option page
